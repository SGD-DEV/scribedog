/**
 * The data folder's own version number, kept in `.scribedog/server-data-version`.
 *
 * It has nothing to do with the app's version: it counts only changes to the
 * layout on disk (the sidecars in `.scribedog/`, the server's files under
 * `.scribedog/server/`). Two things hang off it.
 *
 * - **Migrations.** A folder written by an older server is brought forward on
 *   startup, once, before anything serves a request.
 * - **Downgrade protection.** A folder written by a *newer* server stops this
 *   one from starting. Rolling an image back is the normal reaction to a bad
 *   release, and without this check that would be the moment a new format
 *   gets read by code that predates it, which is how half-written files and
 *   lost sidecars happen. Refusing to start says plainly what to do instead.
